Urbanization is a major driver of global biodiversity loss, yet its impact on microbial communities in soils and host organisms remains poorly understood. This study investigated how urbanization influences the diversity, composition, and ecological assembly processes of microbiomes associated with soil and three widespread epiphytic lichen species—Candelaria concolor, Physcia adscendens, and Xanthoria parietina. Using high-throughput sequencing and ecological modeling approaches, we revealed contrasting patterns of microbial assembly: urbanization significantly shaped soil microbial communities via heterogeneous selection and dispersal limitation, while lichen microbiomes were strongly host-specific and governed mainly by undominated (stochastic and weak selection) processes. This work contributes to a mechanistic understanding of microbiome assembly in urban ecosystems and the roles these microbial communities may play in environmental resilience and host fitness.
